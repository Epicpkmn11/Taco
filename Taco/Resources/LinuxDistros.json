In NixOS, the entire operating system, including the kernel, applications, system packages and configuration files, are built by the Nix package manager. Nix stores all packages in isolation from each other; as a result there are no /bin, /sbin, /lib or /usr directories and all packages are kept in /nix/store instead. Other innovative features of NixOS include reliable upgrades, rollbacks, reproducible system configurations, source-based model with binaries, and multi-user package management. Although NixOS started as a research project, it is now a functional and usable operating system that includes hardware detection, KDE as the default desktop, and systemd for managing system services.\n    ",

And something that had native ReiserFS support built in. We just wanted something better. Something tighter. Something cleaner. Beehive Linux is a distribution made by system administrators, for system administrors. It's intent is to provide fast and clean setup of workhorse servers and workstations. If you're looking for wizards and whizbang gizmos, you are in the wrong place. If you want to setup servers with the services you and/or your users need, you are in the right place. Beehive also works well as a workstation and X, E, BlackBox and KDE are included - this is not the primary focus of Beehive but hey, every admin needs a workstation as well right? Beehive Linux is not for the inexperienced, or those new to linux/*nix. Beehive Linux is for people that know what they're doing and want to get the job done as well as possible in the least amount of time.\n    ",

It was created in August 2016 as a continuation of Netrunner's Kubuntu-based \"Desktop\" edition, but it was re-based on KDE neon which is a more cutting-edge project with frequent updates and a semi-rolling release model. Besides providing a KDE-centric distribution with many popular KDE packages included on the live DVD, the project also focuses on integrating non-KDE software, such as Firefox, Thunderbird or VLC with the underlying infrastructure of the Plasma desktop.\n    ",

Then, after having tested a few of the existing big cdbootable systems that were very slow and had very poor performance, a new project started to take shape in my mind. After some late nights investigating some existing soloutions, my own concept was born: 1. Use a commercial distribution as base (Mandrake Linux). 2. Implement as much as possible of the original functions without many hardware/memory requirements. 3. Put as much software as possible on one cd. 4. Make it easy to configure / Autodetect as much as possible. 5. Implement live filesystem compression. 6. Ramdisk Compression.\n    ",

There are a lot of reasons why somebody would want to install an LFS system. The question most people raise is \"why go through all the hassle of manually installing a Linux system from scratch when you can just download an existing distribution like Debian or Redhat\". That is a valid question which I hope to answer for you. The most important reason for LFS's existence is teaching people how a Linux system works internally. Building an LFS system teaches you about all that makes Linux tick, how things work together, and depend on each other. And most importantly, how to customize it to your own taste and needs.\n    ",

That's the way the TFM Linux idea was born. The simplest method at that time was the adaptation of Red Hat distribution to the needs previously specified. So in March 2001 TFM Linux 1.0 was launched. An easy to install operating system, easy to use as server edition or workstation and adapted for the user's needs. All the knowledge gathered during all this time, allowed the observation of the modified Red Hat distribution limits, and, as future plan, it was established that the next version of the distribution will be done starting from zero, for having complete control to what is happening in the distribution and the packages interactions.\n    ",

To provide an unencumbered RPM-based Linux distribution that retains enough compatibility with Red Hat Linux to allow easy upgrades and to retain compatibility with their errata SRPMs. Being based off of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 means that a machine should be able to avoid the upgrade treadmill until October 2008 since RHEL promises errata availability for 5 years from date of initial release. Or more briefly, to fill the gap between Fedora and RHEL. Why was White Box Linux created? Its initial creation was sponsored by the Beauregard Parish Public Library in DeRidder, USA out of self interest. We have several servers and over 50 workstations running Red Hat Linux and were left high and dry by Red Hat's recent shift in business plan. Our choices were a difficult migration to another distribution or paying Red Hat an annual fee greater than the amortized value of our hardware. So we chose a third path, made possible by the power of open source.... White Box Linux.\n    ",

MoviX2 is a small Linux distro on CD aimed at playing multimedia: when you boot your PC with the MoviX2 CD the distro should be able to start X-Window and launch gmplayer, the GUI interface to mplayer, so that you are left with a nice user-friendly interface you can control by your mouse.

    "Description": "Eagle Linux is a Linux distribution that boots and runs from a floppy or a CD-ROM, saving you the trouble of having to install Linux on your system - and you build it yourself! There is no longer a need to repartition your hard drive or uninstall your current operating system. This is a great feature for academic sectors who may have had systems donated by companies who don't allow the format of the hard drive to be changed (repartitioning). Eagle Linux is also a great embedded systems learning tool, and since you build it yourself, it can easily be created to run on any processor family. What's unique about  Eagle Linux?  It does not use a compressed file system for standard files, making file access faster. It detects and mounts your IDE and SCSI hard drives in write mode, allowing read/write media access. It also offers an easier way for less experienced Linux users to create their own bootable floppy or CD from scratch using the HOW-TOs available on the downloads page.\n    ",

By the end of the year, many thousands of e-smith servers were running in countries from Fiji to Finland. Word was spreading quickly among developers and systems integrators who needed a solid, easy-to-use server for their small-business customers. In July 2001, e-smith was acquired by Mitel Networks, but was later released as an open-source product under the GPL licence. In May 2013 a new not-for-profit organisation was set up to manage SME server. Due to copyright issues it was named Koozali SME Server Inc. The word \"Koozali\" approximates to Swahili for \"rebirth\". Future versions will use this name. The distribution, which is based on CentOS, is currently entirely funded by donations.\n    ",

By making the list of software as small as possible we hope to create a system that is easy to maintain, that requires little space on the hard drive(s) but at the same time is fully functional. We will also try to include configuration scripts for some administrative tasks, like setting up the network, to make it easier to administrate.
